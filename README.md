A few issues arose with the API calls and how I had written the code. I utilized a friend of mine to help walk me through some of the more challenging code and ChatGPT to help debug some errors that elluded me. I also utlized Bootstrap for the CSS layout, Jquery, and OpenWeatherMap API for my weather display.
